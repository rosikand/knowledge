# Web Assembly 

> WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable compilation target for programming languages, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications. ([ref](https://webassembly.org/))

It allows you to compile any language to the web (just like as if you were to compile the program on your native computer). It allows you to write web applications in languages other than javascript.
