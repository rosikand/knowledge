# Week 9, Lecture 2 - Percy's Talk 

> On in-context learning. 

 
Outline: 

1. What transformers can learn in-context (functions!)
2. What exactly is in-context learning (via Bayesian inference)? 


### What is "learning" in in-context learning? 

- **Standard learning**: gradient steps 
- **in-context**: probabilistic inference (computing a posterior) conditioned on in-context samples 


to-do: learn more about icl and vision-icl.
