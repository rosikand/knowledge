# Week 2, Lecture 1 - Internet 

Technical lecture. 

## Internet and phone calls 

- Packet switching in early days --> copper wire connects all the way to the receiver to transmit the signal. Electromechanical. 
  - Idea is to connect your phone wire to a packet center, then the packet center employees connect you to the next packet center and so on. Eventually, you have a wired connection going across the country.
